/**
 * The CubicSurfaceExtractor creates a mesh in which each voxel appears to be rendered as a cube
 *
 * @par Introduction
 * Games such as Minecraft and Voxatron have a unique graphical style in which each voxel in the world appears to be rendered
 * as a single cube. Actually rendering a cube for each voxel would be very expensive, but in practice the only faces which need
 * to be drawn are those which lie on the boundary between solid and empty voxels. The CubicSurfaceExtractor can be used to create
 * such a mesh from PolyVox volume data. As an example, images from Minecraft and Voxatron are shown below:
 *

 *
 * Before we get into the specifics of the CubicSurfaceExtractor, it is useful to understand the principles which apply to *all* PolyVox
 * surface extractors and which are described in the Surface Extraction document (ADD LINK). From here on, it is assumed that you
 * are familier with PolyVox regions and how they are used to limit surface extraction to a particular part of the volume. The
 * principles of allowing dynamic terrain are also common to all surface extractors and are described here (ADD LINK).
 *
 * @par Basic Operation
 * At its core, the CubicSurfaceExtractor works by by looking at pairs of adjacent voxels and determining whether a quad should be
 * placed between then. The most simple situation to imagine is a binary volume where every voxel is either solid or empty. In this
 * case a quad should be generated whenever a solid voxel is next to an empty voxel as this represents part of the surface of the
 * solid object. There is no need to generate a quad between two solid voxels (this quad would never be seen as it is inside the
 * object) and there is no need to generate a quad between two empty voxels (there is no object here). PolyVox allows the principle
 * to be extended far beyond such simple binary volumes but they provide a useful starting point for understanding how the algorithm
 * works.
 *
 * As an example, lets consider the part of a volume shown below. We are going to explain the principles in only two dimensions as
 * this makes it much simpler to illustrate, so you will need to mentally extend the process into the third dimension. Hopefully you will
 * find this intuitive. The diagram below shows a small part of a larger volume (as indicated by the voxel coordinates on the axes) which
 * contains only solid and empty voxels represented by solid and hollow circles respectively. The region on which we are running the
 * surface extractor is marked in pink, and for the purpose of this example it corresponds to the whole of the diagram.
 *

 *
 * The output of the surface extractor is the mesh marked in red. As you can see, this forms a closed object which corresponds to the
 * shape of the underlying voxel data.
 *
 * @par Working with Regions
 * So far the behaviour is easy to understand, but let's look at what happens when the extraction is limited to a particular region of
 * the volume. The figure below shows the same data set as the previous figure, but the extraction region (still marked in pink) has
 * been limited to 13 to 16 in x and 47 to 51 in y:
 *
 * @image html CubicSurfaceExtractor2.png
 *
 * As you can see, the extractor continues to generate a number of quads as indicated by the solid red lines. However, you can also see
 * that the shape is no longer closed. This is because the solid voxels actually extend outside the region which is being processed, and
 * so the extractor does not encounter a boundary between solid and empty voxels. Although this may initially appear problematic, the
 * hole in the mesh does not actually matter because it will be hidden by the mesh corresponding to the region adjacent to it (see next
 * diagram).
 *
 * More interestingly, the diagram also contains a couple of dotted red lines lying on the bottom and right hand side of the extracted
 * region. These are present to illustrate a common point of confusion, which is that *no quads are generated at this position even though
 * it is a boundary between solid and empty voxels*. This is indeed somewhat counter intuitive but there is a rational reasaoning behind
 * it.
 * If you consider the dashed line on the righthand side of the extracted region, then it is clear that this lies on a boundary between
 * solid and empty voxels and so we do need to create quads here. But what is not so clear is whether these quads should be assigned to
 * the mesh which corresponds to the region in pink, or whether they should be assigned to the region to the right of it which is marked
 * in blue in the diagram below:
 *
 * @image html CubicSurfaceExtractor3.png
 *
 * We could choose to add the quads to *both* regions, but this can cause confusion when one of the region is modified (causing the face
 * to disappear or a new one to be created) as *both* regions need to have their mesh regenerated to correctly represent the new state of
 * the volume data. Such pairs of coplanar quads can also cause problems with physics engines, and may prevent transparent voxels from
 * rendering correctly. Therefore we choose to instead only add the quad to one of the the regions and we always choose the one with the
 * greater coordinate value in the direction in which they differ. In the above example the regions differ by the 'x' component of their
 * position, and so the quad is added to the region with the greater 'x' value (the one marked in blue).
 *
 * One of the practical implications of this is that when you modify a voxel *you may have to re-extract the mesh for regions other than
 * region which actually contains the voxel you modified.* This happens when the voxel lies on the upper x,y or z face of a region.
 * Assuming that you have some management code which can mark a region as needing re-extraction when a voxel changes, you should probably
 * extend this to mark the regions of neighbouring voxels as invalid (this will have no effect when the voxel is well within a region,
 * but will mark the neighbouring region as needing an update if the voxel lies on a region face).
 *
 * Another scenario which sometimes results in confusion is when you wish to extract a region which corresponds to the whole volume,
 * particularly when solid voxels extend right to the edge of the volume.
 *
 * This version of the function performs the extraction into a user-provided mesh rather than allocating a mesh automatically.
 * There are a few reasons why this might be useful to more advanced users:
 *
 * @li It leaves the user in control of memory allocation and would allow them to implement e.g. a mesh pooling system.
 * @li The user-provided mesh could have a different index type (e.g. 16-bit indices) to reduce memory usage.
 * @li The user could provide a custom mesh class, e.g a thin wrapper around an openGL VBO to allow direct writing into this structure.
