# Animation

> **IMPORTANT**: Animations are only saved in the `vengi` format or when exported to `gltf`. You should always save to `vengi` and then export from here to any other format that supports animations, too. See [formats](../Formats.md).

## Details

There is a timeline for creating keyframes and you can transform the objects with the guizmo if the editor is in scene mode.

Check out the options in the animation timeline to e.g. create keyframes automatically whenever you change something in the transform data.
